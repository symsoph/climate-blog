Hello! I am an undergraduate studying computer science at UCSD. I put together this blog as a resource for expanding my own and YOUR
understanding of the climate crisis at we know it.  

Because the truth is there is more to this issue than just the climate.

Hopefully, through this blog, you learn and feel empowered to contribute to multilateral climate solutions.


Sincerely,
Sofia
