My first post will be about how I started this project.  Basically, through a required course called Synthesis, I learned about different ways to think about climate change. 

Among many things, I learned about a proposal by Michelle Bastian to tell time differently - without the standard clock - through a piece called [Fatally Confused: Telling the Time in the Midst of Ecological Crisis.](https://www.michellebastian.net/uploads/6/8/8/9/6889024/bastian_-_fatally_confused_2012.pdf) One such suggestion was for all of us to tell time according to a turtle's lifecycle üê¢üêö By telling time differently, perhaps people could better realize that we need to act fast, act right now to mitigate the effects of climate change.

In Synthesis, we even read [short stories](https://grist.org/fix/imagine-2200-climate-fiction-2022/), a beautiful [comic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/18/climate/climate-change-future-kids.html) from the NY TImes, watched Snowpiercer, and listened to podcasts (or read the transcript).  The first podcast we ever listened to fundamentally changed the way I thought of climate change.  In this episode, the hosts interviewed Jacqui Patterson, the Director of the NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Program and she taught me that the climate crisis was racist.  It disportionately affected woman of color and other marginalized, typically poorer, communities. Have a listen to learn how the climate crisis is more than just the environment; it is an intersectional issue involving economy, race, politics, and the climate.  

Now, one thing you may have noticed is that my resources so far are not the typical academic research paper.  Unsuprisingly, these fictional and or "unconventional" media about climate change made the most impact on me. **WHY?** Because the information was disgestible, to the point, and the overall tone was positive. So far, I have found that we need more good news about climate solutions and need to be more aware of the intersectionality of climate change and the local impacts of climate change.  If we feel more connected to and affected by this issue, we are more likely to act to save ourselves and others.  

Now, onwards. üö¢ Check out the links I provided throughout this post.
