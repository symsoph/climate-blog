My first post will be about how I started this project.  Basically, through a required course called Synthesis, I learned about different ways to think about climate change. 

Among many things, I learned about a proposal by Michelle Bastian to tell time differently - without the standard clock - through a piece called [Fatally Confused: Telling the Time in the Midst of Ecological Crisis.](https://www.michellebastian.net/uploads/6/8/8/9/6889024/bastian_-_fatally_confused_2012.pdf) By telling time differently, perhaps people could better realize that we need to act fast, act right now to mitigate the effects of climate change.
