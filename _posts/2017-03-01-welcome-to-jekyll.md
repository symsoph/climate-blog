My first post will be about how I started this project.  Basically, through a required course, I learned about different ways to think about climate change. 

Like, I learned about a proposal by Michelle Bastian to tell time differently - without the standard clock - through a piece called [Fatally Confused: Telling the Time in the Midst of Ecological Crisis.](https://www.michellebastian.net/uploads/6/8/8/9/6889024/bastian_-_fatally_confused_2012.pdf)


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
