Let's try to be more aware of climate change happening around us. I'll go first.

I've been in San Diego my whole life, and it is true - it called Sunny San Diego for a reason.  However, I have noticed changes in this weather pattern, such as how quickly the weather can change.  

Currently, it is incredibly misty.  It started raining about 2 days ago on Friday.  Before Friday, it was sunny then cloudy then sunny.  Lucky I had the foresight to check the weather on Friday when noticing a very cloudy morning; otherwise, I would have come back to my dorm dripping wet and possibly get sick right before finals.  

Speaking of rain, as you know, California is in a drought. Growing up, I thought rarely having rain was normal, but that is not healthy for our climate. It creates dry environments prone to (you guessed it) wildfires ðŸ”¥.  In the last 5 years, my home had more wildfire scares and now, we have more frequent wildfire warnings every summer.  My family is so paranoid that it is customary we clear the dry bush once it is summertime. 

And!

Because it is so dry in California, when we received record rainfall, places flood! In the past, I was aware that places always flooded after the dry season, but this past year, San Francisco was all over the news.  

I am probably only talking about a fraction of the weather changes that have occurred in or around San Diego alone, this thought alone is concerning. 

I do not mean to scare you, or for you to fear the sun or the rain.  There is hope in this world. In this beautiful short story, [The World Away From the Rain](https://grist.org/fix/climate-fiction/imagine-2200-world-away-from-the-rain/) by Ella Menzies, the world fears the rain because it harms.  It is acid rain, but this young Rwandan girl, Keza, sees that there is beauty in this future Earth dealing with the effects of climate change.  She attempts to show her mother this beauty. Read the story to find out the rest, nothing bad happens, promise. 

I love the rain and cold weather the most.  Winter and spring time are my favorite seasons for this reason.  Everything is as green as it gets in Southern California and little birds chirp throughout the day and flowers bloom.  I would hate for the world and for rain to become something I fear.  I hope Keza inspired you to love your home and the environment around, to see the beauty of it, and do something to save it.

## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
